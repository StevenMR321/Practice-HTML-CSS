            Despite the dimensions of the conflict, the Russian government has called it from the beginning a "special military operation in Ukraine" (in Russian , специальная военная операция на Украине , romanization spetsiálnaya voyénnaya operatsiya na Ukraíne ), avoiding the terms of "war" or "invasion".This expression was used for the first time by Vladimir Putin on February 24, 2022 in his speech that launched the invasion.
            <br><br>
            From the opposite point of view, numerous media and people refer to the conflict as "Putin's war", personalizing the responsibility for its unleashing on the Russian president. The terms "Russian war" have also been used, among others. against Ukraine" or "Russian-Ukrainian war" more generally to refer to the entire conflict between

            For their part, the official documents of the Verkhovna Rada (Ukrainian parliament) speak of the "armed aggression of the Russian Federation against the sovereignty of Ukraine". 31 In this sense, international organizations such as the UN and the European Parliament have considered the conflict as a "Russian aggression against Ukraine".32 However, António Guterres, UN Secretary General, told Putin that Russia's actions in
            Ukraine are considered an "invasion".

        INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT

    <img src="Folder Images/Guerra_Fria_1980.png" width="700" height="400" alt="cold_war" />
    <p>
        The post-Cold War era (now called the inter-Cold War period) is the period after the end of the Cold War on December 25, 1991. Because the Cold War was not an active war but rather a period of geopolitical tensions marked by proxy wars, there is disagreement over the official end of this conflict and the subsequent existence of the post-Cold War era. Some scholars claim that the Cold War ended with the signing of the world's first
        nuclear disarmament treaty in 1987 or the end of the Soviet Union as a superpower in the midst of the 1989 Revolutions, but it really ended with the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. Despite this ambiguity, the end of the Cold War symbolized a victory for democracy and capitalism, giving a boost to the United States and the emerging world powers, China and India. Democracy became a form of collects self-validation for countries hoping to earn international respect: when democracy was seen as an important value, political structures began to embrace that value.

From this vision, tensions between powers would be seen as structured within large opposing geopolitical power blocs; in one would be the West and NATO (mainly led by the United States and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, in which the European Union would have a soft power role) and the other (the East) would be made up of one side by China and on the other hand by Russia (supporters of hard power, and who could occasionally have similar interests or go separately, depending on the case). Hybrid war actions (such as cyber attacks) and proxy wars (such as Libya, Syria, Ukraine or Iran) are included. The rivalry, in addition to being geopolitical, would also be of an economic, military, cultural and technological nature.

                The Cold War was a political, economic, social, ideological, military and information confrontation which began at the end of World War II between the Western (capitalist) and Eastern (socialist) blocs, led by the United States and the Union of Republics. Soviet Socialists respectively.

                The first phase of the Cold War began after the end of World War II, in 1945. The United States created the NATO military alliance in 1949, with the aim of curbing Soviet influence in Europe. The Soviet Union responded to the creation of this alliance with the establishment of the Warsaw Pact in 1955. The main crises of this phase included the Berlin blockade of 1948-1949, the second phase of the Chinese civil war (1946-1949), the Korean War (1950-1953), the Suez Crisis of 1956, the Berlin Crisis of 1961, and the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962.

    <p>
        The process of the fall of the Berlin Wall, German reunification and the collapse of the communist governments (1989-1991) brought enormous changes in the Eastern Bloc countries, until then members or allies of the Soviet Union, altering the geopolitical balance. in Europe. However, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine and Russia maintained close ties, and the Ukrainian government agreed to abandon its nuclear arsenal in
        1994—through the Budapest Memorandum—on condition that the United States, the United Kingdom, and Russia will provide guarantees against threats to the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine.37 Five years later, Russia was one of the signatories to the Charter for European Security, which "reaffirmed the inherent right of each and every participating states to be free to choose or change their security arrangements, including alliance treaties, as they evolve.

        <li>The Beginning</li>
        <p>
            Shortly before 06:00 Moscow time (UTC+3) on February 24, a message to Putin's Nation was broadcast on Russian channels announcing his decision to launch a "special military operation" in the east. of Ukraine since, in his words, "Russia cannot feel safe in the face of the Ukrainian threat". Putin added that he would attempt to "demilitarize and denazify Ukraine", justifying the military aggression with the aim of protecting the inhabitants of the self-proclaimed Lugansk People's Republic (LPR) and Donetsk People's
            Republic (DPR) —in the predominantly Ukrainian-speaking region. of Donbass—of the alleged genocide by the Ukrainian government. In his speech, Putin stated that there were no plans to occupy Ukrainian territory and that he supported the right of the peoples of Ukraine to self-determination. At the end of the speech, Putin warned third countries not to interfere in the conflict, saying that "Russia's response will be immediate and will lead them to consequences that they have never experienced in their history," a phrase that sparked debate over its eventual reference to Russia's use of nuclear weapons.

        <li>Central Ukrainian Front (kyiv Offensive)</li>
        <br>
        <img src="Folder Images/Russian_bombardment_of_Kyiv.jpg" width="330" height="339" alt="bombardment" />
        <p>
            The central Ukraine campaign within the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 was a theater of operations for the control of three oblasts (provinces) in this region : Chernihiv, Kiev and Sumy. The capitals of two of these oblasts are less than 100 km from the Russian border via land connections (Chernihiv 90 km and Sumy 50 km).
            <br>
            With the aim of taking the country's capital, Kiev, the Russian army's strategy in northern Ukraine centered on an offensive from the Belarusian border along the western bank of the Dnieper River with the aim of encircling the city from the west. In support of the main offensive, two axes of attack directed from the Russian border on the eastern bank of the Dnieper, one western in the direction of Chernihiv and the other
            eastern in the direction of Sumy, were launched in an attempt to encircle Kiev from the northeast and east.

        <p>
            On April 18, after the escalation of actions, the Ukrainian government began using the term "battle for Donbass" to refer to the offensive. This intensification of fighting had been expected since the beginning of the month, as Russia had withdrawn or been pushed back in other parts of Ukraine and was consequently preparing a phase of its military operations focusing on the east. Thus, approximately 60,000 Russian soldiers left the central Ukraine offensive to be deployed in this region, where there are about 40,000 Ukrainian soldiers.

            Belarus, a close ally of Russia and bordering Ukraine, has supported its eastern neighbor in Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Before the start of the offensive, Belarus allowed the Russian Armed Forces to conduct weeks-long military exercises on its soil. However, the Russian troops did not leave the country after they were supposed to finish. Belarus allowed Russia to carry out part of the invasion from its territory, giving Russia the shortest possible land route to the Ukrainian capital, kyiv.

            Belarus initially denied involvement in the conflict but has since admitted allowing Russian missile launchers stationed on its territory to fire on Ukrainian targets. Several reports surfaced between the Belarusian opposition and the Ukrainian military that Belarusian troops were in Ukraine fighting alongside the Russians, but Belarusian leader Aleksandr Lukashenko dismissed them, saying the Belarusian Armed Forces would not be directly involved in the conflict.

        <li>The case of South Ossetia</li>
        <p>
            A month after the start of the Russian invasion, it was learned that an unknown number of South Ossetian soldiers were sent to Ukraine, possibly a battalion of just over 300 soldiers. Although this could mean the entry of the self-proclaimed republic of South Ossetia into the war, the soldiers sent were regulars from the 4th Guards Military
            Base in Tskhinvali (South Ossetia/Georgia), but framed within the organization chart of the 58. º Russian Combined Arms Army, making it a regular unit of the Russian Army. This is because in March 2017, the South Ossetian armed forces were almost entirely integrated into the Russian Armed Forces, thus they do not have military independence.
            South Ossetian President Anatoly Bibilov declared that he supported Russia in its special military operation, but made no other statements against Ukraine, focusing on South Ossetian regular forces preparing for a possible confrontation with Georgian nationalists. Bibilov's support for the deployment of troops to Russia marked the
            2022 elections,125 in which he lost to the opposition Alan Gagloyev.

            Since the month following the invasion, Russian President Vladimir Putin hascalled for foreign volunteers in response to the Ukrainian International Legion. His appeal was directed especially to the Arab countries of the Middle East where it did not have much impact except in Syria.129 The government of Bashar al-Ásad wanted to stage his country's support for Russia by promoting demonstrations in support of the Slavic
            country in universities and on the streets.
