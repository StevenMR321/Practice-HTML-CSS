            Since the start of the invasion, more than 7 million refugees have fled to the territory of the European Union. Consequently, since March 2022, this flow of people —only Ukrainian nationals— benefits from reception within the EU for a maximum of three years without the need to apply for asylum under the Temporary Protection Directive.

             On the other hand, based on the European Peace Support Fund, on February 28, 2022, the European Union ordered the creation of a cell in charge of coordinating the purchase of weapons to support the Ukrainian government against the Russian attack. The European Commission also decided to mobilize the European Union Satellite Center to provide intelligence services to Ukraine. In this way, the Russo-Ukrainian war allowed the EU to reaffirm itself as a geostrategic force and become involved in a military conflict.
